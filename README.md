This repository contains introductory and tutorial style documentation on
Calm^2.  Reference documentation can be found in the repositories of individual
libraries.

However, this repository is very much **WORK-IN-PROGRESS** and far from
complete.  In the meanwhile, feel free to look at the unfinished documents and
feel free to give feedback, especially if you find that something is left
unclear after reading a section.
