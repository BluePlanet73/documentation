# Tutorial: Composing Components with Calm^2

In this document we build composable components using Calm^2.  This is meant to
be read after the [Introduction to Calm^2](introduction-to-calmm.md), but can
also be readable to experienced programmers who are already familiar with the
ingredients of Calm^2: Observables, Embedding Observables to VDOM, Atoms, and
Lenses.

**This document is WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  Feedback is welcome!**
